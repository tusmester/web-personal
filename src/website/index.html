            <h1>Hi, I’m Miklós! A Software Architect and Product Owner who builds solutions that are reliable and easy to use.</h1>
            <p>Also a sourdough enthusiast, a movie junkie and an optimist. Among other things.</p>

            <h2>Building a great software takes more than just coding.</h2>
            <p>Coding in Visual Studio using C# and .Net is part of my everyday job. Also building a product roadmap and making sure we are on track to realize our vision.</p>

            <h2>Although software is my bread and butter, I also like to bake my own bread.</h2>
            <p>It takes dedication and patience to work with sourdough, but it is a highly rewarding process. With just flour, water and salt you make something vital to the human body and soul.</p>

            <h2>Traveling around the world is a great way to step out of your comfort zone.</h2>
            <p>Thanks to my job and family, I got to travel to places I have never imagined I would go. Hope I’ll be able to put many more pins on the map!</p>
